# Python Projects - CodSoft Internship

This respository contains the Python projects I developed during my internship at Codsoft. The projects demonstrate my understanding of Python and its application in creating interactive and user-friendly applications.

## Project 1: Simple Calculator

I developed a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users input two numbers and choose an operation, and the calculator displays the result.

### Features:

- User-friendly interface
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Project 2: Password Generator

I developed a robust password generator that creates strong, secure passwords. Users specify the desired password length, and the generator combines random characters—uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols to create a unique password.

### Features:

- Customizable password length
- Utilizes a combination of character sets
- Ensures password strength and complexity

## Project 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

I created a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. This interactive game allows users to choose between rock, paper, and scissors, while the computer generates its own random choice. The winner is determined based on the rules, and the game keeps track of scores across multiple rounds.

### Features:

- User-friendly interface
- Randomized computer choices
- Score tracking for competitive fun
